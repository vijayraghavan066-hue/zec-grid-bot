"""Percentage-based, price-following, 5-ladder buy/sell structure for ZEC --
direct port of xrp-grid-bot's pct_ladder.py (itself adapted from
hbar-grid-bot's pct_ladder.py, itself adapted from dash-grid-bot's
ladder_window.py), for ZEC's fresh build onto ZECUSDT 2026-10-09: offsets
1%/2%/3%/4%/5%, built in alongside the coin-reserve sell-side backstop and
bidirectional reinvestment from day one, not retrofitted later.

1. Steps and offsets are PERCENTAGES of price, not fixed dollar amounts --
   scale-invariant, so the same module works at any ZEC price level.

2. Each ladder gets its OWN separate reserve pool (`state.ladder_reserved`,
   keyed by ladder name), not one shared `reserved_total`. A shared pool was
   found (live, on DASH) to pool CORRELATED risk, not diversified risk --
   when price falls, every ladder on the same coin gets stressed at the same
   time, so a shared reserve just means every ladder competes for the same
   shrinking pot during exactly the moment it matters most. Separate pools
   mean each ladder's safety net is sized and funded independently, with no
   cross-ladder drain.

Each ladder's zone is a ONE-SIDED window ending exactly at current price: a
resting buy order above current price can never legitimately fill (it would
cross the spread and execute as a taker), so a symmetric window always
pre-builds roughly half its own capital above price -- permanently idle
unless price rises back past it. A one-sided window doubles real downward
reach for the same capital and keeps every rung positioned to become a real
order as price falls toward it.
